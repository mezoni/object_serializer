# 0.1.2

- Improved serialization performance by 30%. It's about the algorithm for finding a serializer for an object. In the case where the type of the object (by type argument) was known at the time serialization was started, finding a serializer for the this type (using a lookup table) would be faster than searching through all serializers, testing the object in each serializer (`canSerialize(Object? object) => object is T`). The more types are used for serialization, the more noticeable will be the difference in serialization speed with the previous version.
